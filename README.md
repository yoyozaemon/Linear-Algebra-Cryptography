# Linear-Algebra-Cryptography
A project made as a part of the Linear Algebra course (UE20MA251) at PES University. The objective of the project was to demonstrate the applications of Linear Algebra

# Cryptograpaphy
Although there are different methods to encrypt and decrypt messages, we'll focus on a linear algebra-based cipher, the Hill cipher, which uses a matrix as a cipher to encode a message or an image, and it's extremely difficult to break when a large matrix is used.
